# Music Player with Background Starter

This project consists of a music player script (`music_player.py`) and a background starter script (`backgrounder.py`). The music player allows you to play meditation music and provides additional functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library: Install it using `pip install pygame`
- Keyboard library: Install it using `pip install keyboard`

### Usage

1. Place your meditation music files in a folder (`music_folder`).
2. Replace `enter_key_press_sound` with the path to your Enter key press sound file.
3. Replace `other_key_press_sounds_folder` with the path to the folder containing other key press sound files.
4. Run `backgrounder.py` to start the music player in the background.

### Functionality

- **Play/Pause**: Press 'Enter' to play/pause the current track.
- **Next Track**: Press 'D' to skip to the next track.
- **Volume Control**: Use 'W' to increase and 'S' to decrease the volume.
- **Custom Sounds**: Press 'Enter' or 'Backspace' to play custom sounds.

### Customization

You can customize the key bindings and behaviors in the `music_player.py` script to suit your preferences.
